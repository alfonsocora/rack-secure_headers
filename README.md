rack-secure_headers
-------------------

Security related HTTP headers for Rack applications.

Description
-----------

Implements OWASP's [List of useful HTTP headers][owasp].

Usage
-----

```ruby
# config.ru
require "rack/secure_headers"

use(Rack::SecureHeaders, options)
```

Options
-------

This is a list of the supported options included by default.
To disable any default, pass `nil` (e.g. `option: nil`).

| :x_xss_protection                  | X-XSS-Protection                  | `"1; mode=block"`                                   |

Headers
-------

This is a list of the supported HTTP headers:

* **Strict-Transport-Security:**

  Ensures the browser never visits the http version of a website.
  This reduces impact of bugs in web applications leaking session
  data through cookies and external links and defends against
  Man-in-the-middle attacks. Supported options:

  * `:max_age`: The time, in seconds, that the browser should remember that
    the site is only to be accessed using HTTPS. Defaults to 1 year.
  * `:includeSubdomains`: If this is `true`, this rule is applied to all
    of the site's subdomains as well. Defaults to `true`.
  * `:preload`: A limitation of HSTS is that the initial request remains
    unprotected if it uses HTTP. The same applies to the first request
    after the activity period specified by `max-age`. Chrome, Firefox and
    IE11+ implements a "STS preloaded list", which contains known sites
    supporting HSTS. If you would like your domain to be included in the
    preloaded list, set this options to `true` and submit your domain to
    this [form][hsts-form].

* **X-Content-Type-Options:**

  Prevents IE and Chrome from [content type sniffing][mime-sniffing].

* **X-Frame-Options (XFO):**

  Provides [Clickjacking][clickjacking] protection. Supported values:

  * `DENY` - Prevents any domain from framing the content.
  * `SAMEORIGIN` - Only allows current site to frame the content.
  * `ALLOW-FROM URI` - Allows the specified `URI` to frame the content
    (only IE8+ and Firefox).

  Check the [X-Frame-Options draft][x-frame-options] for more information.

* **X-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies:**

  Restrict Adobe Flash Player's access to data. Check this [article][pcdp]
  for more information.

* **X-XSS-Protection:**

  Enables the [XSS][xss] protection filter built into IE, Chrome and Safari.
  Supported values are `0`, which disables the protection, `1` which enables
  it and `1; mode=block` (default) which tells the browser to block the
  response if it detects an attack. This filter is usually enabled by default,
  the use of this header is to re-enable it if it was disabled by the user.

headers used by your site.
